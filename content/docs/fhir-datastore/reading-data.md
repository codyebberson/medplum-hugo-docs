# Reading Data

A very common operation is reading the data of a specified resource given its `id`. The FHIR `read` operation is used by sending an HTTP `GET` request.

Medplum also provides the `readResource` helper function as a part of the `MedplumClient`. This function takes a `resourceType` and `id` of the resource you would like to read.
